Lab 2: APIs

This lab contains 5 files:
- lab2.html contains the markup for the weather app
- lab2.css contains the styling for the markup
- lab2.js contains the JavaScript code that get the user's current location and then reports the current weather, plus the weather for the next 4 days. This is done using Weather Underground's API.
- bg.jpg is the background image used
- screenshot.png is a screenshot of the running app
- README.txt is this current file

Please see the lab2.js for more information about the specific implementation of the app. I wanted to go with a clean and concise format for my app, and I think I accomplished that.

The JS file also includes error checking if the user's geolocation cannot be retrieved. In order to get geolocation working on my machine, I used the first answer on this StackOverflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5423938/html-5-geo-location-prompt-in-chrome

Using this, I was able to get the geolocation working by going to http://localhost:8000/lab2.html. screenshot.png shows what I see when I visit there.

Have a nice day! :)
